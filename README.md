# Final Schematic of Circuit

![Picture_3][picture_3]

  This is the schematic that I created through looking at my truthtable and using my simplified boolean equations.  It allowed me to easily insert the right signals into VHDL to be simulated in ISIM. For example, we can see on the schematic that the combination of "001," or "A'B'C" should give us an output of "XYZ," or "111."  By looking at the schematic we can see that this checks out.
