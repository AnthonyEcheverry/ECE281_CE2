#Analysis

-The Behavioral Waveform created is the same exact thing as the Structural Waceform.  Both had the same exact outputs.  For instance, for for the input "001" we get "1000" for both waveforms.  Both of the wavefoms are exactly the same and follow the schematic precisely.

-Both waveforms (structural and behavioral) also show the same results because they are both made from the same circuit.  

-A decoder is a device that can take multiple inputs and then give a single output. Decoders are used in computers to decode addresses for memory and as the AND and OR gates.  For instance, Read Only Memory(ROM) is slower than Memory ICs because ROM is an array of OR gates, and Memory IC has a much bigger decoder.  In short, a decoder is a collection of logic gates.
